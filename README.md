# Microsite example for personal portofolio

In this project we attempt to build a customized portofolio microsite. Building a custom microsite usually isn't worth the trouble. Use [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), [Shorby](https://dash.shor.by/smartpage?&lp), or [s.id](https://home.s.id/microsite) instead.
